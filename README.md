Flag my patient
===============

This is a simple demo app (web/phone/tablet) to alert clinicians if a patient under their care is admitted.

It is common for clinicians to want to be alerted when a patient under their care has an emergency attendendance. This is often true for patients with a history of cancer.  Don't use this app! It is just a demo and would be very unsafe to use.
